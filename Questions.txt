Questions For Java Lab

Is an interface considered an object? Or is this more of a type that guarantees certain methods will be invoked for an object?

Are interfaces the best way to handle types that do not share a common base class?

Why would a programmer use multilevel inheritance of classes when interfaces are available?

Why is reflection not suited to work for primitives, why does the primitive classs have to be mimicked?

I am not sure I fully understand the need for an instance initializer as opposed to just using the constructor?

I find it strange that a subtype of List has to be used and java doesnt support instantiating a variable of type List, does that mean anytime a list is declared in java it must always implement a subtype?

Does Java provide support for methods that are asynchronous?
